### Notes

* Consider complexity. How fast does your code run? How does it scale?
* Consider cases where we want N primes.
* Do not use the Prime class from stdlib (write your own code).
* Write tests. Try to demonstrate TDD/BDD.
* If youâ€™re using external dependencies please specify those dependencies and how
to install them.
* Please package your code, OR include running instructions.
