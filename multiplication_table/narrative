How I approached this solution

I thought that I had already done something where I created a list of prime numbers in a kata years ago.
Turns out I did not - only prime factors so I did a quick search on how to generate prime numbers.
Looks like the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes is the most efficient way.
This is probably the only named Sieve I know of so let's start there.

./spec/prime_number_spec.rb

Since we are displaying a multiplication table in a terminal window we don't have to know about too many prime numbers.
Imagine what the screen would look like when the numbers in the row is larger than the width of the screen.
So arbitrarily I decided that we'll know about the first 10000 primes - a large but managable number.
I found that the 10000th prime is 104729 and 10001st is 104743 so let's set the max integer to determine to the 10000th + 1.

I'll use the Ruby Prime class to verify that the PrimeNumber#sieve method is accurate.
